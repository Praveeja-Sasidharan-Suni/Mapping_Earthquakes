# Mapping Earthquakes 

## Overview of Project

Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater
than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

1. ***Deliverable 1***: Add Tectonic Plate Data
2. ***Deliverable 2***: Add Major Earthquake Data
3. ***Deliverable 3***: Add an Additional Map
4. ***Deliverable 4***: A written report on the Mapping Earthquakes analysis. 
 

## Resources:

* Data Tools: JavaScript, JSON, GeoJSON 
* Software: ES6+, ECMAScript and Visual Studio Code 1.50.0


# Deliverable 1:  

## Add Tectonic Plate Data

Using our knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we will add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate data to
stand out on the map,and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

Final map with street view:

Final map with Satellite view:

Final map with tectonic plate data added:

# Deliverable 2: 
 
## Add Major Earthquake Data


Using our knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we will add major earthquake data to the map using `d3.json()`, and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the
 magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, `geoJSON()`.

Final map with major Earthquake data added:

# Deliverable 3:  

## Add an Additional Map

Using our knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js, add a third map style to your earthquake map.A third map tile layer is created.
The third map is added to the overlay object.All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the all maps of the webpage.

 Final map with a dark tile layer

All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on Satellite tile layer.

All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on street tile layer.

# Deliverable 4:  

A written report on the Mapping Earthquakes analysis is added.
